    - More secure
    - Faster
    - Stores a larger amount of data
    - Stored data is not sent with every server request-->

    - sessionStorage()
    - localStorage()
    Local vs. Session
    - Session Storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser
    - Local Storage stores data with no expiration date You need to be familiar with basic JavaScript in order to understand and use the API.-->
    
    <!-- The syntax for web storage for both local and session storage is very simple and similar. The data is stored as key/value pairs.
    The same syntax applies to the session storage, with one difference: Instead of localStorage, sessionStorage is used-->

    ErrorHandler(optional): Defines the callback method that is invoked when an error occurs in processing the asynchronous call.
    Options (optional): Defines a set of options for retrieving the location information. -->
    
    <!-- User location can be presented in two ways: Geodetic and Civic.
    1. The geodetic way to describe position refers directly to latitude and longitude.
    2. The civic representation of location data is presented in a format that is more easily read and understood by the average person. ie. city/country name
    The getCurrentPosition() method returns an object if it is successful. The latitude, longitude, and accuracy properties are always returned.-->
